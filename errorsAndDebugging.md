# Error's and Debugging
## 1. Dissect the Error
- When an error first appears on your screen, find the line in the error specific to your code. 
- Lots of error messages have tons of boilerplate details that arenâ€™t important to the actual error. 
- You want to find the part of the error message that gives you insight about what happened. 
 - That line is generally at the top of the error stack trace.
